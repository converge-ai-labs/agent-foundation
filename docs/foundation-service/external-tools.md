# External tools

Foundation Service selects external tools by managed ConnectorConnection or MCPConnection. Create the resource in the same Workspace before selecting it in an Agent configuration.

```json
{
  "connector_tools": [
    {
      "connector_connection_id": "cconn_1234567890abcdef",
      "tools": ["search"],
      "defer_loading": false
    }
  ],
  "mcp_tools": [
    {
      "mcp_connection_id": "mcpc_1234567890abcdef",
      "defer_loading": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Tool names in `tools` are exact source names. Omit `tools` or use `null` to allow all tools from that source. Use `[]` to allow none. A connection can appear only once in each list. Source aliases, inline URLs or credentials, and `exposure` are rejected.

`defer_loading` defaults to `false`, which makes selected definitions immediately visible. With `true`, the Harness exposes the group through its built-in `load_capability` tool. This changes model visibility; discovery and authorization still run during preparation.

A Run override inherits an omitted `connector_tools` or `mcp_tools` list. A supplied list replaces that entire category, and `[]` clears it. A null category is invalid. For example, `{"mcp_tools": []}` removes remote MCP selections while inheriting Connector selections.

## Application Accounts and event reception

An Application Account represents one provider account, Bot, or concrete application installation. Configure its credentials through `/api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/application-accounts`. Credentials are write-only and encrypted on the Account.

Create an optional Ingress using `account_id`, `provider_config: {"events_transport": "http"}`, its execution Service Account, allowed Agents, and default Agent. Each account has at most one Ingress. Routes beneath that Ingress select how events reach Agents. Pausing Ingress stops new input; already accepted Runs can still reply within their admitted scope. Disabling the Account blocks both new input and subsequent outbound calls.

Account tools are injected automatically from the Run's trusted execution context. There is no Account selection in Agent configuration or Run overrides. An Ingress supplies only its admitted reply actions and target. A trusted non-Ingress entry can supply explicit proactive actions and destinations. With no such context, the Run gets no Account tools; creating an Account alone does not expose it to every Agent. Clearing `connector_tools` or `mcp_tools` does not remove these default tools.

For proactive sends, Slack accepts `channel_id` and `text` within the entry-authorized `channel_ids`; Lark accepts `chat_id` and typed `content` within `chat_ids`. GitHub scope contains exact repositories, and its tools accept a permitted repository ID, issue/PR number, and target kind. Tools cannot choose another Account or credential. Proactive sends do not automatically create an Ingress Thread binding.

## Discovery and execution

Acceptance validates managed resources and permissions without contacting external servers. The executing Worker discovers the selected sources. A missing explicitly selected tool fails preparation. Tool schemas can change between Attempts; acceptance does not retain schema snapshots. Use explicit names to limit which tools a source can contribute.

Every connection receives a separate capability and stable, system-generated tool names. Names are normalized and shortened for model APIs; the source-native name remains the value used in `tools` selections and provider calls. Two accounts at the same remote URL remain independent. Connector tools use a local in-process MCP server. Remote MCP uses the upstream client directly from the Worker. Credentials are resolved from current managed state before outbound requests, and each dispatch checks the current Attempt and resource authority.

Inbound Slack, Lark, and GitHub reply actions use the protected target admitted with the input event. The model supplies action content, not a destination, connection, or credential. Receive-only input contributes no native tools. Replies preserve the admitted conversation binding. An uncertain write remains an unknown outcome and is not automatically repeated.

Discovery is bounded per source to 128 pages, 2,048 tools, and 16 MiB of tool definitions. Each result is bounded to 1 MiB. Invalid schemas, external schema references, excessive nesting, and oversized definitions or results fail explicitly.

## Host integration

Worker composition provides `WorkerRuntime.external_tools`. A host constructing `HarnessDriver` passes this collaborator as `external_tools`; the driver creates and closes fresh capabilities around each Attempt's Harness execution. Admission integrations use `connectivity.native_context.IngressRunContext.from_batch()` and retain its JSON as one entry in the accepted Run's `native_tool_contexts`. For proactive operations, a trusted entry calls `bind_account_tools()` inside its short acceptance transaction with the execution actor, Workspace, exact Account, allowed actions, and authorized target scope, then persists the returned context in that tuple. The entry owns target authorization; the helper checks Account use and scope validity. Neither context comes directly from public input or a model argument.

Replacement Attempts and inherited continuations retain these contexts and resolve fresh credentials. New child Runs receive no parent native contexts by default. The Harness sees ordinary MCP capabilities and needs no Account-specific configuration.

Control owns Account and connection management, setup, OAuth refresh, and cleanup. Connectivity owns inbound delivery and admission. Workers own tool discovery and outbound execution. No local MCP listener or separate MCP service is needed.

## Development database setup

The initial migrations create the current schema directly, without persisted tool catalogs or Run tool snapshots. If a local database was created from the previous schema, recreate it and reauthor Agent configurations with connection-selection lists. Existing revision stamps cannot update rewritten initial migrations. Skill, Plugin, and Environment locks keep their existing contracts.
